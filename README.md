# End-to-End Platform Boilerplate

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive boilerplate for building an end-to-end platform on AWS. It covers various components including Lambda functions in Python, DynamoDB, API Gateway, S3, and related configurations. The boilerplate is designed to provide a solid foundation for rapidly developing scalable and resilient serverless applications.

## Features
1. **Lambda Functions**: Python-based Lambda functions are used for implementing business logic, data processing, and handling various API requests.
2. **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database DynamoDB is utilized for storing and managing structured data.
3. **API Gateway**: API Gateway enables the creation and management of RESTful APIs to interact with Lambda functions.
4. **S3**: Simple Storage Service (S3) is used for storing static assets such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
5. **End-to-End Design**: The boilerplate is designed to showcase an end-to-end architecture from client-side interactions to backend processing.


## Implementation Details
This boilerplate also includes an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend built with Bootstrap 5 for styling and asynchronous API calls. The frontend interacts with the backend Lambda functions through API Gateway endpoints, allowing seamless communication between the client and server.
